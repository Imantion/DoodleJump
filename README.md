This version of Doodle Jump is built entirely in pure C++, with the only framework function being to draw sprites. The game is played using arrow keys for movement, and players can shoot with the mouse, adding a unique twist to the gameplay. It's a demonstration of using minimal framework support to create engaging and functional gameplay mechanics from scratch.

All that you need is clone repo and build. In case of error check if binaries are in target dir

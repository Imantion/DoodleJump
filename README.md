This version of Doodle Jump is built entirely in pure C++, with the only framework function being to draw sprites. The game is played using arrow keys for movement, and players can shoot with the mouse, adding a unique twist to the gameplay. It's a demonstration of using minimal framework support to create engaging and functional gameplay mechanics from scratch.
